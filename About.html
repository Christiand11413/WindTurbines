					<p>Hey there! My name is Christian Torres. I have been working in the wind industry for three years, mainly focusing on keeping turbines running strong and 
					helping bring new ones online. I started out doing services and maintenance work as a third-party contractor on 2 MegaWatt (MW) and 4MW platforms like the 
					V110s, V136s, and V150s, making sure they stayed in top shape and ran safely. After a year, I had the privilege to join one of the top green energy 
					establishments, Vestas Wind. I joined a specialized commissioning team, where we were responsible for getting brand new turbines up and running right after 
					construction. These days, I work as part of the CIM/Main Component team, handling heavy corrective work like main bearing replacements. 
					One of the proudest moments of my career so far was helping complete the first up-tower main bearing split ever done in the United States. 
					I built this site to help inform anyone curious about wind turbines and what it is like working on them. My goal is to grow it into a community where 
					technicians can share their experiences, trade advice, and help each other as we keep moving the renewable energy industry forward.
